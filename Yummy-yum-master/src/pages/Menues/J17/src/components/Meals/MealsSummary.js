      <p>
      The "Vegan J17" restaurant located on Jeremiah Street in Tel Aviv is one of the most heartwarming and palatable places in the city. 


      </p>
      <p>
The restaurant offers fun and poseless hospitality, sitting outside on the nice street or inside the place, and a 100% vegan food menu, simple and very fine, in a homely and invested style.      </p>
