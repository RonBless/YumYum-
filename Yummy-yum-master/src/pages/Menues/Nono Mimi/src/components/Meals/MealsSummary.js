      <h2>Nono Mimi </h2>
      <p>
We set up NONO just as we dreamed: family-friendly, warm, a menu inspired by southern Italy, self-production of wine, ice cream, pastries and pasta, the best raw materials, wood-burning stoves and a spirit of generosity and love. We have waited a long time for this moment, and now we are here, getting up every morning with a smile, excited and trying our best, to provide you with the perfect experience.      </p>
      <p>
And MIMI is another old dream come true, in which you will find a variety of products that we all make by hand, fresh and fresh every day.      </p>
